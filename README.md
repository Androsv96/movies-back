# Movies API

## Overview

Movies API is a GraphQL API that serves as a bridge between the Movies frontend and [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) REST API. This API is built using TypeScript as the programming language, Node.js as the server framework, and Apollo Server to handle queries and mutations, schema, etc.

## Getting Started

To get started with this API, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have those installed, you can follow the steps below:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.

- Run npm install to install all dependencies.

- Run npm run dev to start local development.

- Run npm run lint to run the ESLinter.

## Production
